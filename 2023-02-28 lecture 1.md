batch vs online vs realtime
realtime has **temporal constraints**

transformational vs reactive - during the program's execution, do you interrupt it (reactive) or not (transformational - interrupts are useless. e.g. any data processing)

---

sequential vs parallel vs concurrent
parallel -> many sequences of execution happening at the same time
concurrent -> +synchronization, resource management

---

cyber-physical systems

---

reactive- {
- programming
- functional programming
- systems / applications
}

message vs event
a message is sent/received
an event is handled

---

hard -> absolutely no room for not respecting time constraints, even in the worst case
soft -> deadlines are important but failures are acceptable (e.g. multimedia -> you want a fixed, stable FPS, but it's fine if you occasionally drop frames)
firm -> if a deadline is missed, the output becomes useless, but not catastrophic
